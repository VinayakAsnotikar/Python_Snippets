## Random code

1)[RandomPasswordGenerator.py](RandomPasswordGenerator.py): This is a basic python code to generate random 16 character passwords using letters (caps and small), numbers and symbols using random module.

## Sorting Algorithms
A sorting algorithm is used to rearrange a given list or an array of elements in a defined order, either increasing or decreasing.

1)[Insertion_Sort.py](RandomPasswordGenerator.py): Simple python code for Insertion sort method.This sorting algorithm involves finding the right place for each element in the array. We begin by taking the first two elements and finding the position of each relative to the other. We then add the third element and compare it to the previous elements and find its position. Other elements are added gradually to the sorted list until the list is exhausted.

2)[Bubble_Sort.py](Bubble_Sort.py): Simple python code for Bubble sort method. This is quite similar to insertion sorting algorithm but differs in some ways. In this algorithm, we only compare adjacent elements and we then swap them if they are not in order. It is way much simpler to understand as compared to the previous algorithms.

3)[Selection_sort.py](Selection_sort.py): Simple python code for Selection sort method. Here, we get the smallest element in a list and take it to a copy list, then repeat the process for the remaining elements until all of the elements have been sorted in the list.

## Searching algorithms
A searching algorithm is used to check the presence of an element in a list or array and displays the position of the element in the list or array or will return a False if it is non-existent in the list. 

This involves looking for a specific element in a list or array of elements. It detects its presence and will return a True or false if present or absent respectively. It can also return the position of the element in the list if it is present and return an ‘absent statement’ if it’s absent.

1)[Linear_searching.py](Linear_searching.py): This is one of the searching algorithms that involves sequentially going through every element in the list until the element is located and its position is enumerated. This method might take a long time to run if the list or array is quite long and the element being searched is deep in the array. This is the disadvantage of this method. However, this method is quite handy as it can search in an unsorted list unlike the other method of searching that we will come to later.
