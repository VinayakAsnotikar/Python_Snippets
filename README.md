# Python_Snippets
1)[RandomPasswordGenerator.py](RandomPasswordGenerator.py): This is a basic python code to generate random 16 character passwords using letters (caps and small), numbers and symbols using random module.

2)[Insertion_Sort.py](RandomPasswordGenerator.py): Simple python code for Insertion sort method.This sorting algorithm involves finding the right place for each element in the array. We begin by taking the first two elements and finding the position of each relative to the other. We then add the third element and compare it to the previous elements and find its position. Other elements are added gradually to the sorted list until the list is exhausted.

3)[Bubble_Sort.py](Bubble_Sort.py): Simple python code for Bubble sort method. This is quite similar to insertion sorting algorithm but differs in some ways. In this algorithm, we only compare adjacent elements and we then swap them if they are not in order. It is way much simpler to understand as compared to the previous algorithms.

4)[Selection_sort.py](Selection_sort.py): Simple python code for Selection sort method. Here, we get the smallest element in a list and take it to a copy list, then repeat the process for the remaining elements until all of the elements have been sorted in the list.
